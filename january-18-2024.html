    <h1>Dear Fahima,</h1>

<p>I hope you're doing well. I'm definitely not. I saw a TikTok you reposted,
    <img src="tiktok.png" alt="TikTok Screenshot">
<p>and it just ruined me. I don't know if you maybe misunderstood the TikTok, but it still hurt me.
<p>That doesn't matter, though. I hope you kept your promise about making a note every month. Maybe you did, maybe you didn't. Maybe you're not even reading this note right now. I'll never know.
<p>I hope you're doing well. I'm still proud of you even though we had a bad split. 
<p>I want to express my appreciation for the positive moments we shared. Though things have changed, I still cherish the moments we've had together.<p>

    <p>Best,<br>
