    <h1>Dear Fahima,</h1>

    <p>I hope you're doing well. I'm definitely not. I saw a TikTok you reposted,
        <img src="tiktok.png" alt="TikTok Screenshot"></p>

    <p>and it just ruined me. I don't know if you maybe misunderstood the TikTok, but it still hurt me.</p>

    <p>That doesn't matter, though. I hope you kept your promise about making a note every month. Maybe you did, maybe you didn't. Maybe you're not even reading this note right now. I'll never know.</p>

    <p>I hope you're doing well. I'm still proud of you even though we had a bad split.</p>

    <p>I want to express my appreciation for the positive moments we shared. Though things have changed, I still cherish the moments we've had together.</p>

    <div data-tf-widget="tXBuQm1Z" data-tf-opacity="100" data-tf-iframe-props="title=Checking Up" data-tf-transitive-search-params data-tf-medium="snippet" style="width:100%;height:500px;"></div>
    <script src="//embed.typeform.com/next/embed.js"></script>

    <p>Best,<br>
    Eren</p>
