    <p>To my dearest Fahima,</p>

    <p>Your words have given me joy in the most profound way possible. With my full heart, I agree with your perspective that love expressions and affection should not be given only on special occasions. Love should be a constant force that goes through our daily lives.</p>

    <p>Your commitment to showing your love through writing, and despite any “corny” feelings you may have, only shows me that you’re heavy (emphasis on heavy) about your sincerity and devotion to our relationship. I appreciate every word you say to me, and I recognize that each line is proof of the depth of your emotions. I not only find your love language of writing extremely adorable, but I appreciate and love every piece of writing you give me.</p>

    <p>Your statement about wanting to get more comfortable with me lines up exactly with my dreams with you. I want us to be able to communicate and feel safe together.</p>

    <p>Your understanding and acceptance with the reassurance that judgment has no place in our relationship create so much trust with us. The way you’re willing to patiently go through the huge complication of my less expressive person only proves your commitment and love. The commitment you express to go through the highs and lows with me only proves my belief in the strength of our love together. I believe that conflict and arguments between us are necessary to build a strong relationship. This proves to me that you’re mature and trying to have a happy loving relationship with me, and so am I.</p>

    <p>Let’s talk about the problems I may be having mentally; your support and encouragement act as a “light in the darkness” if you know what I mean. Knowing that I can reach out to you during my lowest moments is extremely comforting. You believe in my strength even when I’m doubting myself and my own abilities.</p>

    <p>You recognize my achievements, leaving me extremely loved. You support my accomplishments, and that proves to me the effort you’re putting into our relationship. The fact that you notice the smallest of things about me without me telling you, such as when I’m upset, leaves me in such a loving and amazing state.</p>

    <p>As I read through your message again and again, I’m overwhelmed with a sense of love and appreciation. I sincerely appreciate your commitment to showing your feelings through writing, and the promise of many more such messages in the future leaves me in excitement. The love you give me is kind of a treasure that I hold close to my heart, and I will hold forever. I love you more than words can show, and I’m waiting on the fun adventures that the future will hold for us. I love you so much, Fahima.</p>

    <p>With all my love,<br>Eren<br>December 30, 2023</p>
